# Ubuntu docker image with imapsync

### Notes

- Fastest by far see image in attachments
- Needs some optimization
- There is a bug that doesn't seem too affect the transfers in any way however [here is a link](https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/issues/293)
  * It should be adressed with IO::Socket::SSL 2.073
